By being born in 1995 I fall automatically into the Generation Z. The main feature of my generation is that we have witnessed the digital revolution since our childhood. We grew up with Messenger, then experienced the rise of Facebook right in the beginning of our teen years and we even killed Instagram by feeding our Insta stories with billions of senseless pictures and videos. We have been the guinea pigs of the attention economy oligopoly. And we have been terribly good at it. And it worked so well for Facebook, Apple, Amazon and Google, that a quick look at [Fortune 500](https://fortune.com/fortune500/2019/search/?franchisepreview=true), makes us realize that our attention is as valuable as Canadian bituminous sands or Saudi gas fields. What has my generation received on exchange? We are provided with free services such as social media, streaming services like YouTube or information a click away with Google. And free email, which is actually important and useful, but not exempt of hazardous traits. All just in exchange of our attention. And enduring nagging ads.

It seems like a good deal. Even better, a gift from God to make our generation be happier and more succesful than the preceding ones. But not all that shines is gold. There is a plethora of hidden costs. Some of them are obvious, some of them hardly are. Based on the readings of [Cal Newport's](http://www.calnewport.com/about/) excellent books [Deep Work](http://www.calnewport.com/books/deep-work/) and [Digital Minimalism](http://www.calnewport.com/books/digital-minimalism/), I will lay out an explanation of how the digital revolution is no free lunch. This will also be an optimal opportunity to make my own review on the previous books. Finally, it will also serve me to share some very useful and personally illuminating insights directly rellevant to the current world we live in. Stay tuned.
