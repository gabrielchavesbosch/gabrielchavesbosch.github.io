This is my first post ever. I am working on creating a blog using GitHub and Jekyll, by following [Justin James' guide](https://digitaldrummerj.me/blogging-on-github-part-1-getting-started/). I have done very little programming before this. Creating a blog this way is a good exercise for improving coding skills. But this is not my primary goal. My primary goal is to write a thorough blog to organize my opinions and ideas regarding topics I am interested in. Here we go, world!
