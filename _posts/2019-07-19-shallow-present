This is my first post ever. I am working on creating a blog using GitHub and Jekyll, by following 
[Justin James' guide](https://digitaldrummerj.me/blogging-on-github-part-1-getting-started/). 
I have done very little programming before this. Creating a blog this way is a good exercise for improving coding skills.
But this is not my primary goal. My primary goal is to write a thorough blog to organize my opinions and ideas regarding 
topics I am interested in. Here we go, world!
