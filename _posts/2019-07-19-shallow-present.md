By being born in 1995 I fall automatically into the Generation Z. The main feature of my generation is that we 
have witnessed the digital revolution since our childhood. We grew up with Messenger, then experienced the rise of Facebook 
right in the beginning of our teen years and we even killed Instagram by feeding our Insta stories with billions of senseless 
pictures and videos. We have been the guinea pigs of the attention economy oligopoly. And we have been terribly good at it.
And it worked so well for Facebook, Apple, Amazon and Google, that a quick look at [Fortune 500](https://fortune.com/fortune500/2019/search/?franchisepreview=true)
makes our attention as valuable as Canadian bituminous sands or Saudi gas fields. What has my generation received on exchange? We are provided with free services such as social media, streaming services like 
YouTube or information a click away with Google. All just in exchange of our attention. And enduring nagging ads.

It seems like a good deal.
